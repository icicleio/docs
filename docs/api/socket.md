This library is a component for [Icicle](https://github.com/icicleio/icicle), providing an asynchronous stream socket server, client, connector, and datagram. Like other Icicle components, this library uses [Promises](https://github.com/icicleio/icicle/wiki/Promises) and [Generators](http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.generators.overview.php) for asynchronous operations that may be used to build [Coroutines](https://github.com/icicleio/icicle/wiki/Coroutines) to make writing asynchronous code more like writing synchronous code.

##### Requirements

- PHP 5.5+

##### Suggested

- [openssl extension](http://php.net/manual/en/book.openssl.php): Enables using SSL/TLS on sockets.

##### Installation

The recommended way to install is with the [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) package manager. (See the [Composer installation guide](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) for information on installing and using Composer.)

Run the following command to use this library in your project:

```bash
composer require icicleio/socket
```

You can also manually edit `composer.json` to add this library as a project requirement.

```js
// composer.json
{
    "require": {
        "icicleio/socket": "^0.3"
    }
}
```

The socket component implements network sockets as coroutine-based streams, server, and datagram. Creating a server and accepting connections is very simple, requiring only a few lines of code.

The example below implements a simple HTTP server listening on 127.0.0.1:8080 that responds to any request with the contents of the client request as the body of the response. This example is implemented using coroutines (see the [Coroutine API documentation](https://github.com/icicleio/icicle/wiki/Coroutines)) and the basic sockets provided by this package.

```php
use Icicle\Coroutine\Coroutine;
use Icicle\Loop;
use Icicle\Socket\Client\Client;
use Icicle\Socket\Client\ClientInterface;
use Icicle\Socket\Server\Server;
use Icicle\Socket\Server\ServerInterface;
use Icicle\Socket\Server\ServerFactory;

$server = (new ServerFactory())->create('localhost', 8080);

$generator = function (ServerInterface $server) {
    printf("Server listening on %s:%d\n", $server->getAddress(), $server->getPort());

    $generator = function (ClientInterface $client) {
        $request = '';
        do {
            $request .= (yield $client->read(0, "\n"));
        } while (substr($request, -4) !== "\r\n\r\n");

        $message = sprintf("Received the following request:\r\n\r\n%s", $request);

        $data  = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n";
        $data .= "Content-Type: text/plain\r\n";
        $data .= sprintf("Content-Length: %d\r\n", strlen($message));
        $data .= "Connection: close\r\n";
        $data .= "\r\n";
        $data .= $message;

        yield $client->write($data);

        $client->close();
    };

    while ($server->isOpen()) {
        // Handle client in a separate coroutine so this coroutine is not blocked.
        $coroutine = new Coroutine($generator(yield $server->accept()));
        $coroutine->done(null, function (Exception $exception) {
            printf("Client error: %s\n", $exception->getMessage());
        });
    }
};

$coroutine = new Coroutine($generator($server));
$coroutine->done();

Loop\run();
```

#### Function prototypes

Prototypes for object instance methods are described below using the following syntax:

```php
ClassOrInterfaceName::methodName(ArgumentType $arg): ReturnType
```

## SocketInterface

All socket classes in this component implement `Icicle\Socket\SocketInterface`.

#### isOpen()

```php
SocketInterface::isOpen(): bool
```

Determines if the socket is still open (connected).

---

#### close()

```php
SocketInterface::close(): void
```

Closes the socket, making it unreadable or unwritable.

## Server

The `Icicle\Socket\Server\Server` class implements `Icicle\Socket\Server\ServerInterface`, a coroutine-based interface for creating a TCP server and accepting connections.

#### Server Constructor

```php
$server = new Server(resource $socket)
```

Creates a server from a stream socket server resource generated from `stream_socket_server()`. Generally it is better to use `Icicle\Socket\Server\ServerFactory` to create a `Icicle\Socket\Server\Server` instance.

---

#### accept()

```php
ServerInterface::accept(): Generator
```

A coroutine that is resolved with a `Icicle\Socket\Client\ClientInterface` object when a connection is accepted.

Resolution | Type | Description
:-: | :-- | :--
Fulfilled | `Icicle\Socket\Client\ClientInterface` | Accepted client connection.
Rejected | `Icicle\Socket\Exception\BusyException` | If the server already had an accept pending.
Rejected | `Icicle\Socket\Exception\UnavailableException` | If the server was previously closed.
Rejected | `Icicle\Socket\Exception\ClosedException` | If the server is closed during pending accept.

---

#### getAddress()

```php
ServerInterface::getAddress(): string
```

Returns the local IP address as a string.

---

#### getPort()

```php
ServerInterface::getPort(): int
```

Returns the local port.

## ServerFactory

`Icicle\Socket\Server\ServerFactory` (implements `Icicle\Socket\Server\ServerFactoryInterface`) can be used to create server instances from a hostname or unix socket path, port number (`-1` for unix socket), and list of options.

#### create()

```php
ServerFactoryInterface::create(
    string $host,
    int $port,
    mixed[] $options = []
): ServerInterface
```

Creates a server bound and listening on the given host and port.

Option | Type | Description
:-- | :-- | :--
`backlog` | `int` | Connection backlog size. Note that the operating system variable `SOMAXCONN` may set an upper limit and may need to be changed to allow a larger backlog size.
`pem` | `string` | Path to PEM file containing certificate and private key to enable SSL on client connections.
`passphrase` | `string` | PEM passphrase if applicable.
`name` | `string` | Name to use as SNI identifier. If not set, name will be guessed based on `$host`.

## ReadableStream

`Icicle\Socket\Stream\ReadableStream` implements `Icicle\Stream\ReadableStreamInterface`, so it is interoperable with any other class implementing one of the stream interfaces.

See the [ReadableStreamInterface API documentation](https://github.com/icicleio/stream#readablestreaminterface) for more information on how readable streams are used.

When the other end of the connection is closed and a read is pending, that read will be fulfilled with an empty string. Subsequent reads will then reject with an instance of `Icicle\Stream\Exception\UnreadableException` and `isReadable()` will return `false`.

#### ReadableStream Constructor

```php
$stream = new ReadableStream(resource $socket)
```

Creates a readable stream from the given stream socket resource.

## WritableStream

`Icicle\Socket\Stream\WritableStream` implements `Icicle\Stream\WritableStreamInterface`, so it is interoperable with any other class implementing one of the stream interfaces.

See the [WritableStreaminterface API documentation](https://github.com/icicleio/stream#writablestreaminterface) for more information on how writable streams are used.

#### WritableStream Constructor

```php
$stream = new WritableStream(resource $socket)
```

Creates a writable stream from the given stream socket resource.

## DuplexStream

`Icicle\Socket\Stream\DuplexStream` implements `Icicle\Stream\DuplexStreamInterface`, making it both a readable stream and a writable stream. It also implements `Icicle\Socket\Stream\DuplexSocketInterface`, adding an optional parameter `float $timeout = 0` to the stream methods as described in the sections above on [ReadableStream](#readablestream) and [WritableStream](#writablestream).

See the [ReadableStreamInterface API documentation](https://github.com/icicleio/stream#readablestreaminterface) and [WritableStreamInterface API documentation](https://github.com/icicleio/stream#writablestreaminterface) for more information on how duplex streams are used.


#### DuplexStream Constructor

```php
$stream = new DuplexStream(resource $socket)
```

Creates a duplex stream from the given stream socket resource.

## Client

`Icicle\Socket\Client\Client` objects implement `Icicle\Socket\Client\ClientInterface` and are used as the fulfillment value of the coroutine returned by `Icicle\Socket\Server\Server::accept()` ([see documentation above](#accept)). (Note that `Icicle\Socket\Server\Server` can be easily extended and modified to fulfill accept requests with different objects implementing `Icicle\Socket\Client\ClientInterface`.)

The class extends `Icicle\Socket\Stream\DuplexStream`, so it inherits all the readable and writable stream methods as well as adding those below.

#### Client Constructor

```php
$client = new Client(resource $socket)
```

---

Creates a client object from the given stream socket resource.

#### enableCrypto()

```php
ClientInterface::enableCrypto(int $method, float $timeout = 0): Generator
```

Enables encryption on the socket. For Client objects created from `Icicle\Socket\Server\Server::accept()`, a PEM file must have been provided when creating the server socket (see `Icicle\Socket\Server\ServerFactory`). Use the `STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_*_SERVER` constants when enabling crypto on remote clients (e.g., created by `Icicle\Socket\Server\ServerInterface::accept()`) and the `STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_*_CLIENT` constants when enabling crypto on a local client connection (e.g., created by `Icicle\Socket\Client\ConnectorInterface::connect()`).

---

#### getLocalAddress()

```php
ClientInterface::getLocalAddress(): string
```

Returns the local IP address as a string.

---

#### getLocalPort()

```php
ClientInterface::getLocalPort(): int
```

Returns the local port.

---

#### getRemoteAddress()

```php
ClientInterface::getRemoteAddress(): string
```

Returns the remote IP address as a string.

---

#### getRemotePort()

```php
ClientInterface::getRemotePort(): int
```

Returns the remote port.

## Connector

The `Icicle\Socket\Client\Connector` class (implements `Icicle\Socket\Client\ConnectorInterface`) asynchronously connects to a remote server, returning a coroutine that is fulfilled with an instance of `Icicle\Socket\Client\Client` when the connection is successfully established. Note that the *host should be given as an IP address*, as DNS lookups performed by PHP are synchronous (blocking). If you wish to use domain names instead of IPs, see `Icicle\Dns\Connector\Connector` in the [DNS component](https://github.com/icicleio/dns).

#### connect()

```php
ConnectorInterface::connect(
    string $host,
    int $port,
    mixed[] $options = []
): Generator
```

Connects asynchronously to the given host on the given port.

Option | Type | Description
:-- | :-- | :--
`protocol` | `string` | The protocol to use, such as tcp, udp, s3, ssh. Defaults to tcp.
`timeout` | `float` | Number of seconds until connection attempt times out. Defaults to 10 seconds.
`cn` | `string` | Host name (common name) used to verify certificate. e.g., `*.google.com`
`allow_self_signed` | `bool` | Set to `true` to allow self-signed certificates. Defaults to `false`.
`max_depth` | `int` | Max levels of certificate authorities the verifier will transverse. Defaults to 10.
`cafile` | `string` | Path to bundle of root certificates to verify against.

Resolution | Type | Description
:-: | :-- | :--
Fulfilled | `Icicle\Socket\Client\ClientInterface` | Fulfilled once the connection is established.
Rejected | `Icicle\Socket\Exception\FailureException` | If the connection attempt fails (such as an invalid host).
Rejected | `Icicle\Promise\Exception\TimeoutException` | If the connection attempt times out.

## Datagram

The `Icicle\Socket\Datagram\Datagram` class implements `Icicle\Socket\Datagram\DatagramInterface`, a coroutine-based interface for creating a UDP listener and sender.

#### Datagram Constructor

```php
$datagram = new Datagram(resource $socket)
```

Creates a datagram from a stream socket server resource generated from `stream_socket_server()`. Generally it is better to use `Icicle\Socket\Datagram\DatagramFactory` to create a `Icicle\Socket\Datagram\Datagram` instance.

---

#### receive()

```php
DatagramInterface::receive(int $length, float $timeout): Generator
```

A coroutine that is fulfilled with an array when a data is received on the UDP socket (datagram). The array is a 0-indexed array containing the IP address, port, and data received, in that order.

Resolution | Type | Description
:-: | :-- | :--
Fulfilled | `array` | IP address, port, and data received.
Rejected | `Icicle\Socket\Exception\BusyException` | If the server already had an accept pending.
Rejected | `Icicle\Stream\Exception\UnavailableException` | If the server was previously closed.
Rejected | `Icicle\Stream\Exception\ClosedException` | If the server is closed during pending accept.

---

#### send()

```php
DatagramInterface::send(
    string $address,
    int $port,
    string $data
): Generator
```

Send the given data to the IP address and port. This coroutine is fulfilled with the amount of data sent once the data has successfully been sent.

Resolution | Type | Description
:-: | :-- | :--
Fulfilled | `int` | Length of data sent.
Rejected | `Icicle\Socket\Exception\BusyException` | If the server already had an accept pending.
Rejected | `Icicle\Stream\Exception\UnavailableException` | If the server was previously closed.
Rejected | `Icicle\Stream\Exception\ClosedException` | If the server is closed during pending accept.

---

#### getAddress()

```php
DatagramInterface::getAddress(): string
```

Returns the local IP address as a string.

---

#### getPort()

```php
DatagramInterface::getPort(): int
```

Returns the local port.

## DatagramFactory

`Icicle\Socket\Datagram\DatagramFactory` (implements `Icicle\Socket\Datagram\DatagramFactoryInterface`) can be used to create datagram instances from a hostname or unix socket path, port number (`-1` for unix socket), and list of options.

#### create()

```php
DatagramFactoryInterface::create(
    string $host,
    int $port,
    mixed[] $options = []
): DatagramInterface
```

Creates a datagram bound and listening on the given host and port. No options are defined in this implementation.
